# Gesture Detection

Building a model that detects four different gestures (thumb up, thumb down, ok sign and thank you) by collecting and labeling images for Object Detection using LabelImg, train Deep Learning powered Object Detection Models using Python and Tensor FlowObject Detection, detect objects in real time using a webcam and using Images, tune Object Detection models to improve Precision and Recall, export the model to TFLite.
